# LivePersonChallenge
Answer to the LivePerson challenge

Best/preferred way to run this quickly -
1. Open Code Sandbox at https://codesandbox.io/
2. Create a new JavaScript instance
3. Copy+paste the code from the file LivePersonChallenge.js on GitHub into the index.js file created in this instance
4. Watch the output on the console to the right
5. Alternatively, we can use a local server on our computer to run the JavaScript file too or an extension on Visual Studio Code like Code Runner
6. If any steps don't work or make sense, please reach out to dylanbferns@gmail.com
