# LivePersonChallenge
Answer to the LivePerson challenge

Best/preferred way to run this quickly is to open Code Sandbox at https://codesandbox.io/

Copy+paste all the code in the file LivePersonChallenge.js into the JavaScript file and run
Alternatively, we can use a local server on our computer to run the JavaScript file too or an extension on Visual Studio Code like Code Runner
